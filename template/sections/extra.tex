\section{Extra? work}

Just as in last submission, we kept the extra work we did and now we are just going to make an overview in the following \textit{Code \ref{makefile}}.

\begin{code}{title=Some examples of Makefile commands,label=makefile}{bash}
    $ make all      # Compiles the different C files and runs the MPI program
    $ make test     # Compares the '.bmp' files in the results directory
    $ make time     # Extracts the execution times from the log in the output files
    $ make clean    # Removes all resulting files
    #... There are some others but they are irrelevant for the purpose of this assignment
\end{code}

\subsection{Testing}
As we talked about in the last assignment, we did some automatic testing that compared the resulting BMP files of the serial version with the rest (depending on size and iterations, obviously).
In the last submit, it was not that needed since the solution was just adding a few lines of code, but in this one, which was harder, really shined since we had to do some iterations and it was easier to track some errors.
